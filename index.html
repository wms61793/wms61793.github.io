	The Call of Duty League is a professional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports">Esports</a> league with a prize pool of <b>$5,000,000</b>.
	The league consists of 5 major events, with each team competing in 5 matches every week to determine seeding for the major tournament at the end of every month. The league houses 12 teams from 4 different countries, each competing for a chance at the <b>$500,000</b> grand prize up for grabs at each of the 5 majors, and <b>$1,200,000</b> to the winner of the big tournament at the end of the season.
	</p>
	<p>
	Heavy favorites Atlanta FaZe started off the season strong by winning the first major handily before being knocked off by the lesser known Toronto Ultra squad in the Grand Finals of Major 2. <q>Need to get my SnD better, I've been <strong>expletive</strong> bad. No excuses though, weâ€™ll be better for the next one.</q> <em>said Chris "Simp" Lehr, FaZe's star SMG player</em>, after their shocking loss to the Ultra last Sunday.
	</p>
	<p>
	OpTic FormaL <i>(Pictured below)</i> is another player that expects nothing but greatness out of himself and the teams he plays on. With a disappointing inaugural season for Chicago Huntsman <i>(Now OpTic Chicago)</i>, they're looking to bounce back from their slow start to the 2021 season after failing to finish in the top 3 at the first two majors.
